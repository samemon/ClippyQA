Welcome to our Progress Report for ClippyQA, a question answering agent for wikipedia articles.
Our goal is to have a question generation system that produces a specified list of questions based
on an input wikipedia article, as well as a question answer system that can answer any question regarding
the article, not just our own.

So far we have two question generation systems: one using relationship extraction, and another using dependency parsing.
We have also completed several pre-processing tasks such as named entity recognition, coreference resolution, etc

TOOLS
We are using the following tools:
NeuralCoref - To handle coreference resolution
spaCy - For named entity recognition and dependency parsing
NLTK - for tokenization
and OpenNRE - for relationship extraction

Our first question generation model
